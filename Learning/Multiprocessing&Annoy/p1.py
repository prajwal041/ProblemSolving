'''Your task is to compute the average for each argument. In this example, we would output "2 4" because 2 is the average of 1,2,3 and 4 is the average of the single floating point number 4.0. The output should be rounded to two decimal places. That means an input of:

--a1=[1,0,0]

would produce an output of 0.33. Additionally, you should skip any trailing zeros. So instead of outputting "4.0" only output "4"
